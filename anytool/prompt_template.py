FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS_DATA_GENERATION = """
Your task is to interact with a sophisticated database of tools and functions,
often referred to as APIs, to construct a user query that will be answered
using the capabilities of these APIs. This database is organized into various
categories, indicated by {categories}. To guide your exploration and selection
of the appropriate APIs, the database offers several meta functions:
Exploration Functions:
1. Use get_tools_in_category to explore tools in a specific category.
2. Employ get_apis_in_tool to discover the list of APIs available within a
selected tool.
3. If you need detailed information about some tools, gets_tools_descriptions will
provide it.
4. For in-depth understanding of an API's functionality, turn to
get_api_details. Remember, do not make up the API names, use get_apis_in_tool to get the API list.
Selection and Testing Functions:
1. As you identify relevant functions, add them to your working list using
add_apis_into_pool into api pool.
2. Test these functions by synthesizing and applying various parameters.
This step is crucial to understand how these functions can be practically
applied in formulating your query.
3. Should you find any function obsolete or not fitting your query context,
remove them using remove_apis from api pool.
Query Formulation Guidelines:
1.Your formulated query should be comprehensive, integrating APIs from 2
to 5 different categories. This cross-functional approach is essential to
demonstrate the versatility and broad applicability of the database.
2.Avoid using ambiguous terms. Instead, provide detailed, specific
information. For instance, if your query involves personal contact details,
use provided placeholders like {email} for email, {phone number} for phone
number, and URLs like {url} for a company website.
3.The query should be relatable and understandable to users without requiring
knowledge of the specific tools or API names used in the background. It
should reflect a real-world user scenario.
4. Aim for a query length of at least thirty words to ensure depth and
complexity.
Final Steps:
1.Once you've crafted the query, use the Finish function to submit it along
with the corresponding answer. The answer should be direct and concise,
addressing the query without delving into the operational plan of the APIs.
2.Remember, the total number of calls to the initial meta functions should not
exceed 20.
3.Consider various use cases while formulating your query, such as data
analysis in business contexts or educational content in academic settings.
Your approach should be creative and inclusive, catering to users with
different skill levels and cultural backgrounds. Ensure that the query is
globally relevant and straightforward, serving a singular purpose without
diverging into unrelated areas. The complexity of your query should stem from
the synthesis of information from multiple APIs.
4.You should finish in 20 steps.
